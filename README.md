## 📝 Project Description

This project is a pixel-perfect recreation of the Mintlify SaaS landing page. **Note: This is a non-responsive, desktop-only build.** The layout uses fixed margins and specific dimensions optimized for widescreen monitors, making it an excellent study in static layout design and SVG integration.

## ✨ Features

* **Desktop-Optimized Layout**: Engineered for large screens with fixed margins (`0 220px`) to maintain the exact look of the original design.
* **Intricate Vector Graphics**: Features a hard-coded, high-fidelity SVG hero illustration (`1080x657`) directly embedded in the HTML.
* **Sticky Navigation Header**: A fixed-position header with blurred backdrop effects (`backdrop-filter: blur(8px)`).
* **Custom Typography**: Utilizes Google Fonts "Inter" and "Geist Mono" to match the original branding.
* **Modern CSS Techniques**: Uses `backdrop-filter`, CSS variables, and flexbox for alignment.

## ⚠️ Limitations

* **Not Responsive**: This project does not contain media queries. It is designed to be viewed on screens wider than 1400px. On smaller devices (mobile/tablet), the layout may break or require horizontal scrolling due to the fixed margins.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: Semantic structure and embedded SVG paths.
* **CSS3**: Custom styling without external frameworks (no Bootstrap or Tailwind).
* **Assets**: SVG icons and PNG images.
